# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project aims to create a web-based tool that allows users to upload 2D images (PNG/JPEG) and convert them into 3D models using an AI-assisted process. The converted 3D models can be exported in various formats (GLTF, OBJ, X-File) and potentially used to generate animated pictures or videos with AI-driven fantasy reconstruction and movement. The project will utilize a metadata container to store information about the generated 3D objects to aid in reconstruction and animation.

## Current Progress

- **Image Upload Button and Preview:** An HTML structure with a file input styled as a button and an image preview area has been added.
- **Image Upload Button and Preview:** An HTML structure with a file input styled as a button and an image preview area has been added.
- **File Handling:** JavaScript code has been implemented to handle file selection, read image data, and display an image preview.
- **Basic Styling:** Basic CSS has been added to style the upload button and the image preview.
- **Three.js Setup:** The Three.js environment (scene, camera, renderer) has been set up in `main.js`.
- **Metadata Container:** A basic metadata container has been implemented in `main.js` to store information about the uploaded image.

## Implemented Features

- **Three.js Setup:** The Three.js environment (scene, camera, renderer) has been set up in `main.js`.
- **Metadata Container:** A structure for the metadata container has been created and populated with image information on upload, and refined to include potential 3D model and animation information, as well as references to a graphic database.
- **GLTF Export:** Basic GLTF export functionality has been implemented (exports a placeholder cube, will be updated to export the generated mesh).
- **2D-to-3D Conversion Placeholder:** A function `convertImageTo3D` has been added as a placeholder for the AI conversion logic.
- **Anti-Aliasing:** The Three.js renderer has been configured to enable anti-aliasing, with a note that the level can be adjusted (referencing the 32*-128* range).
- **High-Frame-Rate Rendering Loop:** A rendering loop capable of achieving a high frame rate (up to 200 fps) has been implemented.
- **KI-Fantasy Animation Placeholder:** A function `applyFantasyAnimation` has been added as a placeholder for the AI-driven fantasy animation logic, called within the rendering loop.
- **Graphic Database Reference:** The concept of using a 'graphicdatabasecontainer' (e.g., DirectX versions 9.0c-12) as a reference for 'KI-Fantasy' reconstruction and animation has been introduced. Metadata fields and placeholder functions for interacting with this database have been added.
- **Frame Capturing:** Functionality to capture rendered frames from the Three.js canvas has been added to prepare for video/GIF encoding.
- `.idx/dev.nix`: Development environment configuration.
- **Metric calculation Network Construction:** The `MeshGenerator.py` script will be used for metric calculations and network construction from the image data. It will utilize the **NumPy** library for these calculations and image processing.
- `.idx/mcp.json`: Project configuration file.
- `.vscode/settings.json`: VS Code editor settings.
- **Layered Calculation:** A layered calculation approach is used for processing the image based on foreground (+), middle ground (0), and background (-). This approach is part of the Metric calculation Network Construction and influences the 3D reconstruction.
- **Horizontal Layered Calculation:** A horizontal layered calculation approach is used for the right (+), middle (0), and left (-) sections of the image. This is combined with the vertical layering in the Metric calculation Network Construction.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **KI-Meshconverter Implementation:** Integrate or develop the AI-assisted 2D-to-3D mesh conversion logic. This is the core and most challenging part, requiring a specialized AI model or integration with an external service.
- **OBJ and X-File Export:** Implement export functionality for OBJ and X-File formats.
- **Animation and Video Generation:** Explore and implement methods for generating animations or videos from the 3D models, potentially with AI-driven fantasy reconstruction and movement.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Improve the user interface for better usability and visual appeal.
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Add robust error handling and validation for file uploads and the conversion process.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the code and 3D models for performance, especially for high-resolution meshes.

*   Three.js
*   AI/Machine Learning (for 2D-to-3D conversion - integration with external service or custom implementation)

## Open Issues

- The core "KI-Meshconverter" functionality is not yet implemented and requires a solution for 2D-to-3D AI conversion.
- Animation and video generation from 3D models need to be explored and implemented.
- OBJ and X-File export might require additional libraries or custom code.
- Error handling and validation need to be added.
- The interaction with the 'graphicdatabasecontainer' needs to be defined and implemented.
